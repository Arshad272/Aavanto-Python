# Identity Operators 

# is
# is operator will return true, if both variables are pointing to same memory location

a = 10
b = 10 
c = a
print(a is c)

# is not
# is not operator will return true, if both variables are not pointing to same memory location... This is exact oposite of "is" operator
print(a is not c)
