# Arithematic operators

a = 4
b = 4

# Addition '+' 
add = a + b
# print(add)

# Substraction '-' 
sub = a - b
# print(sub)

# Multiplication '*' 
mul = a * b 
# print(mul)

# Division '/'
div = a / b 
# print(div) # Here you will get output in Float Number

# Floor Division '//'
f_div = a // b
# print(f_div) # Here you will get output in Int Number

# Modulo Operator '%'
mod =  a % b 
# print(mod)

# Exponential '**' 
exp = a ** b 
# 4 power 4 = 4 X 4 X 4 X 4 = 256
print(exp)
