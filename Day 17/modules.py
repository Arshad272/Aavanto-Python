# modules
# module is just a python code / python file

# types of modules
# 1. built in modules
#       these modules comes along with the installation of python

# 2. user defined modules
#       we can also create our own modules
 
# 3. third party modules
#       these does not comes along with the installation of python. we need to install these modules extrnally to use them. 

# math module

# syntax:
# import module_name 
# module_name.function_name(args)

import math 

# sqare root -> root(49) = 7 => 7 * 7 = 49

# print(math.sqrt(36))

# ceil -> if value is greater than n.0 means we will get output as n + 1
# print(math.ceil(4.1))

# floor -> if value is greater than n.0 means we will get output as n
# print(math.floor(4.1)) 

# if n is odd means:
# round -> if value is greater than or equal to n.5 means we will get output as n+1 and if value is less than n.5 means we will get output as n

# if n is even means:
# round -> if value is greater than n.5 means we will get output as n+1 and if value is less than or equal to n.5 means we will get output as n
print(round(5.5))


# print(math.sin(20))
# print(math.cos(50))

# print(math.pow(5, 3)) 
# 4 ** 2
